OBJECTIVE:
This program will allow the user to play Hangman against the computer using a list of words from the txt file.
- A function that randomly selects a word from the text dictionary
- A function that takes imput from the user which will be each letter guessed
- A function that will take the letters guessed correctly and turn them into a string
- We need to create the various variables to store the users inputted data
    - We need a variable for the word the computer picks
    - We need to create a set of data that holds the letters guessed wrong and the letters guessed right by the user
- We need to display an intro to the program
- We need to build a repetitive system, so that the user can keep guessing letters
- If the player guesses wrong, a new part of the body is drawn, until they lose.
- We will add statements at the end and the beginning that welcome and thank the user for playing
